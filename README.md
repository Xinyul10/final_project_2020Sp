Description: While I was analyzing the data I found before about the payment of patient and the financial fund from government, I found there are some mismatch of the two dataset and meaningless to handle them. Thus, from the data of payment, I got a more global analysis topic about the potential things that could affect Average Health Expenditure. Here, I included some potential influencing factors  from both nature and man-made, which are: fuel exports and Forest Coverage, GDP, Population Growth and Household Scale. I would not only analyze these data from the degree of different countries but also add some time series to prove whether there is a more close correlation within each couple. But due to the fact that some origin data is not that integral, it may be some inaccuracy in my analysis and once I found it, I would point it and improve it later. 

Project Type: (Type II Projects) Specifics for an Original Data Analysis [Non-simulation]

Hypothesis:
1. As the increase of fuel export and decrease Forest Coverage, the average annual health expenditure would increase accordingly.

2. The Average annual health expenditure may have a linear relationship with GDP and Population Growth.

3. The proportion the annual health expenditure accounting for GDP may have relation with the household scale.
