## Title: The potential variables correlated with Average Health Expenditure

### Team Member: Xinyu Liu (xinyul10)

### Purpose and Description: 
I got hurt one day and understand the cost of going to hospital, which seems not to be a very reasonable number. So I wonder something about the health expenditure from government and want to explore the potential variables correlated with it. Here, I included some potential influencing factors from both nature and man-made, which are: fuel exports and Forest Coverage, GDP, Population Growth and Household Scale. I would not only analyze these data from the degree of different countries but also add some time series to prove whether there is a more close correlation within each couple. But due to the fact that some origin data is not that integral, it may be some inaccuracy in my analysis and once I found it, I would point it and improve it later. 

### Project Type: 
(Type II Projects) Specifics for an Original Data Analysis [Non-simulation]

### Hypothesis:
1. As the increase of fuel export and decrease of Forest Coverage, the annual health expenditure per capital would increase accordingly.

2. The health expenditure per capital or expenditure by revenue may have a linear relationship with GDP.

3. The health expenditure per capital or expenditure by revenue may have relation with the household scale.
